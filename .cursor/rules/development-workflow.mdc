When I ask for a feature:

1. Write plain-English summary (WHAT + WHY).
2. List dependencies (with reason).
3. Show file structure changes.
4. Deliver COMPLETE, running code (no TODO placeholders).
5. Provide test data + test steps.
6. Anticipate common errors + fixes.
7. Suggest 2-3 “future scale” improvements (but do NOT build yet).
