description:
1. Mobile-first design ALWAYS.
2. Core flow (compare prices) in ≤ 3 clicks.
3. Loading skeletons > spinners.
4. Never empty state → always seed placeholders.
5. Validation must be inline, human-readable.
6. Follow Skyscanner/Trivago UI flows for now (don’t reinvent).
7. Accessibility: alt text on all images, focus states, ARIA labels.
8. Keep visual identity consistent (Tailwind defaults → design tokens later).
