# 🚀 PostgreSQL Migration Guide for ShopStation

## 🎯 Overview

This guide will help you migrate your ShopStation data from JSON files to PostgreSQL on Railway, ensuring **zero data loss** and persistent storage that survives deployments.

### ✅ Migration Readiness Confirmed
- **4 Kosher Stores**: B Kosher, Tapuach, Kosher Kingdom, Kays
- **6 Products**: All with valid pricing data across multiple stores
- **16 Price Entries**: Complete price comparison data preserved
- **Data Quality**: 100% production data, test data filtered out
- **Business Value**: All manually entered prices preserved

---

## 🏗️ Pre-Migration Setup

### 1. Add PostgreSQL to Railway Project

1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Click on your ShopStation project
3. Click "New" → "Database" → "Add PostgreSQL"
4. Railway will automatically create `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### 2. Verify Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Railway:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (automatically created by Railway)
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
NODE_ENV=production
```

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation

### 1. Run Data Cleaning
```bash
npm run prepare-migration
```

This will:
- ✅ Clean and validate your existing data
- ✅ Remove test data and inconsistencies  
- ✅ Create migration-ready backup
- ✅ Generate detailed preparation report

### 2. Review Preparation Report

Expected output:
```
📈 Data Statistics:
   Stores: 4 → 4
   Products: 16 → 6 (test data filtered)
   Prices: 28 → 16 (cleaned and validated)

🏪 Production Stores Ready for Migration:
   B Kosher (Hendon Brent Street): 5 products
   Tapuach (Hendon): 4 products
   Kosher Kingdom (Golders Green): 4 products
   Kays (Hendon): 3 products

✅ MIGRATION READY: true
```

---

## 🚀 Migration Execution

### 1. Deploy to Railway with PostgreSQL

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for PostgreSQL migration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Run Migration Script

**In Railway Console** (recommended):
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Open your project
3. Click on your service
4. Go to "Settings" tab
5. Run this command:

```bash
npm run migrate:postgres
```

**Or locally with production DATABASE_URL**:
```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-railway-postgres-url" npm run migrate:postgres
```

### 3. Expected Migration Output

## ✅ Post-Migration Verification

### 1. Test Admin Panel

Visit your admin panel and verify:
- ✅ All 4 stores are visible
- ✅ All products show correct prices
- ✅ Add new product works
- ✅ Update prices works
- ✅ Delete functionality works

### 2. Test Grocery Comparison

Make a comparison request:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app.railway.app/api/compare-groceries" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"groceryList":["milk","challah"]}'
```

Should return all stores with pricing data.

### 3. Verify Product Requests

Test the new product request system:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app.railway.app/api/request-product" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"productName":"organic apples","userName":"Test User"}'
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails: "DATABASE_URL not found"
**Solution**: Ensure PostgreSQL is added to your Railway project and DATABASE_URL is set.

### Migration Fails: "Failed to connect"
**Solution**: Check Railway PostgreSQL service is running and DATABASE_URL is correct.

### Data Missing After Migration
**Solution**: Check migration logs. Run validation:
```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-url" node -e "
const dbOps = require('./database/db-operations');
dbOps.getStores().then(console.log);
"
```

### Admin Panel Shows Empty Data
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and verify API endpoints are working.
