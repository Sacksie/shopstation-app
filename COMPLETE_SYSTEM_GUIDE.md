## 🎯 **What Is ShopStation?**

ShopStation is your grocery price comparison platform that helps customers find the cheapest prices across multiple stores. Think of it like "Expedia for groceries" - customers enter their shopping list, and your system shows them where to get the best deals.

### **Your Business Model:**
- **Free for customers**: They get price comparisons
- **Revenue potential**: Affiliate commissions from stores, premium features, advertising

---

## 🏗️ **System Architecture Overview**

Your ShopStation consists of **two main parts**:

### **1. Frontend (Customer-Facing Website)**
- **Location**: `frontend/` folder
- **Technology**: React (JavaScript framework for websites)
- **What it does**: The website customers see and interact with
- **Live at**: https://shopstation.co.uk

### **2. Backend (Behind-the-Scenes Engine)**
- **Location**: `backend/` folder  
- **Technology**: Node.js (JavaScript for servers)
- **What it does**: Processes price comparisons, stores data, handles admin functions
- **Live at**: https://backend-production-2cbb.up.railway.app

---

## 🔧 **Core System Mechanics**

### **1. Price Comparison Engine**
**Location**: `backend/routes/compare.js`

**How it works:**
1. Customer enters "milk, bread, eggs"
2. System searches your database for these products
3. Finds prices across all stores (B Kosher, Tapuach, Kosher Kingdom, Kays)
4. Returns sorted results showing cheapest to most expensive

**Example customer sees:**
```
Milk 2L:
- Kosher Kingdom: £2.50
- B Kosher: £2.75  
- Tapuach: £2.99
```

### **2. Product Database**
**Location**: `backend/database/kosher-prices.json`

**What it contains:**
- Product names (e.g., "Milk 2L", "White Bread")
- Prices for each store
- When prices were last updated
- Product categories (dairy, bakery, etc.)

**Structure example:**
```json
{
  "milk-2l": {
    "name": "Milk 2L",
    "category": "dairy",
    "prices": {
      "Kosher Kingdom": {"price": 2.50, "unit": "2L"},
      "B Kosher": {"price": 2.75, "unit": "2L"}
    }
  }
}
```

### **3. Smart Product Matching**
**Location**: `backend/routes/compare.js` (fuzzy matching)

**How it works:**
- Customer types "milk" → finds "Milk 2L", "Organic Milk", "Almond Milk"
- Uses fuzzy matching to handle typos: "millk" → "milk"
- Handles aliases: "bread" → finds "White Bread", "Challah Bread"

### **4. Admin Panel System**
**Location**: `backend/routes/manual-entry.js`

**What you can do:**
- Add new products and prices
- Update existing prices  
- Delete outdated products
- View all inventory
- Bulk import from spreadsheets

**Access**: Use your admin password to manage the system

   - Add new product following the existing format
   - Save file

2. **Test your changes:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Search for your new product
   - Verify it appears in results

#### **Updating Store Information**
**File to edit**: `backend/database/kosher-prices.json`

**To add a new store:**
1. Find existing product
2. Add new store to its "prices" section:
   ```json
   "prices": {
     "Kosher Kingdom": {"price": 2.50, "unit": "2L"},
     "New Store Name": {"price": 2.30, "unit": "2L"}
   }
   ```

#### **Changing Website Design**
**Files to edit**: `frontend/src/` folder

**Common changes:**

   - Enter common search: "milk, bread, eggs"
   - Verify results show correctly
   - Check that prices are accurate

2. **Admin Panel Test:**
   - Access admin panel
   - Try adding a test product
   - Verify it appears in search results

#### **Automated Testing (Run Before Deploying)**
**In Claude Code terminal:**
```bash
# Test backend
cd backend
npm test
# Should see: "All tests passed"

# Test frontend  
cd frontend
npm test
# Press 'a' to run all tests, then 'q' to quit
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ All green checkmarks = good to deploy
- ❌ Any red X's = fix before deploying

#### **Quality Gates (Advanced Testing)**
```bash
cd backend
npm run quality-gates
```
**This checks:**

Your data is stored in JSON files, but you have enterprise-grade management tools:

#### **Database Migration Commands**
**Use these when making structural changes:**

```bash
cd backend

# Check current database status
npm run migrate:status

# Create new migration for big changes
npm run migrate:create "Add product categories"

# Apply migrations (safely updates database)
npm run migrate

# Rollback if something goes wrong
npm run migrate:rollback 1
```

#### **Backup System**
**Automatic backups happen:**
- Before every deployment
- Daily at midnight
- Before database migrations

**Manual backup:**
```bash
cd backend
node -e "
const { cloudBackup } = require('./utils/cloudBackup');
cloudBackup.createFullBackup('manual-backup')
  .then(result => console.log('Backup created:', result.backupId));
"
```

**Your backups are stored in**: `backend/backups/` folder

---

### **Phase 5: Deployment Process**

#### **Understanding Your Deployment Setup**
- **Frontend**: Automatically deploys to Vercel when you push to GitHub
- **Backend**: Automatically deploys to Railway when you push to GitHub
- **Domain**: shopstation.co.uk points to your live site

#### **Step-by-Step Deployment**

**Step 1: Final Testing**
```bash
# Run all tests
cd backend && npm test
cd ../frontend && npm test

# Run quality gates
cd backend && npm run quality-gates:strict
```

**Step 2: Commit Your Changes**
**In Claude Code:**
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .
